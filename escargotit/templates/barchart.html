        <h4>What is correlation coefficient?</h4>
        <p>
            The Pearson correlation coefficient, also known as Pearson's r, 
            is a statistical measure used to quantify the strength and direction of 
            the linear relationship between two continuous variables. 
            It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 
            1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. 
        </p>
        <p>In practical terms, when you read a person's correlation coefficient, a value close to -1 
            suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, while a value close to 
            1 implies that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase, and a value near 0 
            indicates that there is no clear linear relationship between the variables.</p>
